# Soil Moisture Detector using LED and Buzzer

The soil moisture detector consists of two probes which are used to measure the volumetric content of water and a buzzer and LED to indicate the low level of the moisture content. The two probes allow the current to pass through the soil and then it gets the resistance value to measure the moisture value. When there is more water, the soil will conduct more electricity which means that there will be less resistance. Therefore, the moisture level will be higher. Dry soil conducts electricity poorly, so when there will be less water, then the soil will conduct less electricity which means that there will be more resistance. Therefore, the moisture level will be lower. This sensor can be connected in two modes; Analog mode and digital mode. The buzzer and LED are used to indicate when the moisture level is low. This Soil Moisture Detector has many applications, especially in agriculture. Irrigation is a key factor in farming. Detecting the amount of moisture in the soil and managing irrigation systems (turn on the system when the moisture level falls below a certain predefined value) helps to avoid a lot of wastage of water and human resources.
